sed
The first is with the p (print) command, and the other is with the d (delete) command.
The n option with the print command is used to only print lines explicitly indicated by the command.
For example, sed will output the 10th line of file.txt with each of the commands below:

print/p command

cat file.txt | sed -n '10p'  # > 73%
delete/d command

cat file.txt | sed '10!d'  # > 73%
awk
awk has a built in variable NR that keeps track of file/stream row numbers.
awk syntax and idioms can be hard to read, so below are three different ways to print line 10 of file.txt file using awk.

cat file.txt | awk 'NR==10'     # > 73%
cat file.txt | awk 'NR==10{print}'  # > 100%
cat file.txt | awk '{if(NR==10) print}'  # >73%
